# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes
***generics*** 
- a tool to handle the duplication of concepts
- abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties

In this chapter,
1. review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication
2. learn how to use ***trait*** to define behavior in a generic way
3. discuss lifetimes: a variety of generics that give the compiler information about how references relate to each other

## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function
Generic allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder(e.g., `T`, `E`) that represents multiple types to remove code duplication



First, the way to remove duplication without generic types.
Example Codes(Finds the largest number in a list):
```rust
fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![32, 59, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```

If we want to find largest numbers in two different lists of numbers, we can duplicate the code.
```rust
fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```
- Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error prone.


To eliminate this duplication, we'll create an abstraction by defining a function that operates on any list of integers passed in a parameter.

Let's make a function to remove duplication.
```rust
fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![32, 59, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
}
```

In summary, here are the steps we took to change the code here:
1. Identify duplicate code.
2. Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function and specify the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.
3. Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function instead.


Let's say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item in a slice of i32 values and one that finds the largest item in a slice of char values. How would we eliminate that duplication? Letâ€™s find out!
