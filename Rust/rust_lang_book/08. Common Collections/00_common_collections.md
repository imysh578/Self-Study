Rust's standard library includes a numbers of very useful data structures called ***collections***.
Collection can contain multiple values.
The data collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.

Three collection used very often:
- ***vector***: stores a variable number of values next to each other.
- ***string***: a collection of characters.
- ***hash map***: associates a value with a particular key.
