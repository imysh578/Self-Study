# Environments
Using [Replit](https://replit.com/) is good enough to follow this lecture without install anything. But VS code is easier to find errors. 
I choose to use VS code because I'm already used to it.

# Installation
Visit [Go website](https://go.dev/) and download the package suitable for your system.

Following instruction to install. (Make sure to check if the directory where you install is correct).
